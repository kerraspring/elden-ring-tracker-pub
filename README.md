# Elden Ring Tracker

This web app allows users to track all bosses and dungeons throughout the vast world of The Lands Between. The map within Elden Ring doesn't provide any indicators that a player has completed a dungeon. I created this app to help players keep track of dungeons and bosses to avoid wasting time going back to these locations to check whether or not they've been completed.
